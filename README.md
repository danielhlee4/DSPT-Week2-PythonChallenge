# Module 1 Code Challenge

This code challenge is designed to test your understanding of the Module 1 material. It covers:

- Pandas
- Data Visualization
- Exploring Statistical Data
- Python Data Structures

_Read the instructions carefully._ You will be asked both to write code and to respond to a few short answer questions.

### Note on the short answer questions

For the short answer questions _please use your own words_. The expectation is that you have **not** copied and pasted from an external source, even if you consult another source to help craft your response. While the short answer questions are not necessarily being assessed on grammatical correctness or sentence structure, you should do your best to communicate yourself clearly.

## Part 1: Pandas [Suggested Time: 15 minutes]
---

In this section you will be doing some preprocessing for a dataset for the videogame [FIFA19](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19). The dataset contains both data for the game as well as information about the players' real life careers.


```python
# Run this cell without changes

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

### 1.1) Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame

The data you'll be working with is in a file called `'./data/fifa.csv'`. Use your knowledge of pandas to create a new DataFrame, called `df`, using the data from this CSV file. 

Check the contents of the first few rows of your DataFrame, then show the size of the DataFrame. 


```python
# Replace None with appropriate code
df = None
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
df = pd.read_csv('./data/fifa.csv')
```


```python
# Code here to check the first few rows of the DataFrame

```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
df.head()
```

```python
# Code here to see the size of the DataFrame

```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
df.shape
```




    (18207, 88)



### 1.2) Drop rows with missing values for `'Release Clause'`
    
Drop rows for which "Release Clause" is none or not given. This is part of a soccer player's contract dealing with being bought out by another team. After you have dropped them, see how many rows are remaining.


```python
# Code here to drop rows with missing values for 'Release Clause'

```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
df.dropna(subset=['Release Clause'], inplace=True)
```


```python
# Code here to check how many rows are left 

```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
df.shape
```




    (16643, 88)



### 1.3) Convert the `'Release Clause'` Price from Euros to Dollars

Now that there are no missing values, we can change the values in the `'Release Clause'` column from Euro to Dollar amounts.

Assume the current exchange rate is `1 Euro = 1.2 Dollars`


```python
# Code here to convert the column of euros to dollars

```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
df['Release Clause'] = df['Release Clause'] * 1.2
```

## Part 2: Data Visualization [Suggested Time: 20 minutes]
---

Continuing to use the same FIFA dataset, plot data using whichever plotting library you are most comfortable with.


```python
# Run this cell without changes

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
```

### 2.1) Find the top 10 countries with the most players (using the `'Nationality'` column). Create a bar chart showing the number of players from those 10 countries.

Don't forget to add a **title** and **x axis label** to your charts.

If you are unable to find the top 10 countries but want the chance to demonstrate your plotting skills use the following dummy data to create a bar chart: 

```
Country Name  | Num Players
============  | ===========
Country A     | 100
Country B     | 60
Country C     | 125
Country D     | 89
```


```python
# Code here to get the top 10 countries with the most players

```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
top_10_countries = df['Nationality'].value_counts()[0:10]
top_10_countries.index
```




    Index(['England', 'Germany', 'Spain', 'France', 'Argentina', 'Brazil', 'Italy',
           'Colombia', 'Japan', 'Netherlands'],
          dtype='object')




```python
# Code here to plot a bar chart.  A recommended figsize is (10, 6)

```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

ax.set_title("10 Countries with the Most Players")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Players")

labels = list(top_10_countries.index)
values = list(top_10_countries.values)
ax.bar(labels, values)
```




    <BarContainer object of 10 artists>

### 2.2) Describe the relationship between `StandingTackle` and `SlidingTackle`, as shown in the scatter plot produced below.


```python
# Run this cell without changes

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.set_title('Standing Tackle vs. Sliding Tackle')
ax.set_xlabel('Standing Tackle')
ax.set_ylabel('Sliding Tackle')

x = df['StandingTackle']
y = df['SlidingTackle']

ax.scatter(x, y)
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.set_title('Standing Tackle vs. Sliding Tackle')
ax.set_xlabel('Standing Tackle')
ax.set_ylabel('Sliding Tackle')

x = df['StandingTackle']
y = df['SlidingTackle']

ax.scatter(x, y)
```




    <matplotlib.collections.PathCollection at 0x11a67eef0>




![png](index_files/index_32_1.png)


Please describe in words the relationship between these two features.


```python
# Your written answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
"""
These two features are highly correlated.
"""
```

## Part 3: Exploring Statistical Data [Suggested Time: 20 minutes]
---

### 3.1) What are the mean age and the median age for the players in this dataset?


```python
# Code here to find the mean age and median age
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
# Code here to find the mean age and median age
df['Age'].describe()
```




    count    16643.000000
    mean        25.226221
    std          4.716588
    min         16.000000
    25%         21.000000
    50%         25.000000
    75%         29.000000
    max         45.000000
    Name: Age, dtype: float64



In your own words, how are the mean and median related to each other and what do these values tell us about the distribution of the column `'Age'`? 


```python
# Your written answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
"""
Mean age = 25.23 
Median age = 25

The average age of all players in the league is 25.22 years. 
The median age is 25 years. Since mean and median are pretty similar, 
age seems to be slightly skewed towards the older end of the spectrum.
"""
```

### 3.2) Who is the oldest player from Argentina and how old is he?
Use the `Nationality` column.


```python
# Code here to find the oldest player in Argentina
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
argentines = df.loc[df['Nationality'] == 'Argentina']

argentines.loc[argentines['Age'].idxmax(), ['Name', 'Age']]
```




    Name    C. MuÃ±oz
    Age           41
    Name: 7225, dtype: object




```python
# Your written answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
"""
The oldest player in Argentina is C MuÃ±oz, and he is 41 years old.
"""
```

## Part 4: Python Data Structures [Suggested Time: 20 min]
---

In this final section, we will work with various Python data types and try to accomplish certain tasks using some fundamental data structures in Python, rather than using Pandas DataFrames. Below, we've defined a dictionary with soccer player names as keys for nested dictionaries containing information about each player's age, nationality, and a list of teams they have played for.


```python
# Run this cell without changes

players = {
    'L. Messi': {
        'age': 31,
        'nationality': 'Argentina',
        'teams': ['Barcelona']
    },
    'Cristiano Ronaldo': {
        'age': 33,
        'nationality': 'Portugal',
        'teams': ['Juventus', 'Real Madrid', 'Manchester United']
    },
    'Neymar Jr': {
        'age': 26,
        'nationality': 'Brazil',
        'teams': ['Santos', 'Barcelona', 'Paris Saint-German']
    },
    'De Gea': {
        'age': 27,
        'nationality': 'Spain',
        'teams': ['Atletico Madrid', 'Manchester United']
    },
    'K. De Bruyne': {
        'age': 27,
        'nationality': 'Belgium',
        'teams': ['Chelsea', 'Manchester City']
    }
}
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
players = {
    'L. Messi': {
        'age': 31,
        'nationality': 'Argentina',
        'teams': ['Barcelona']
    },
    'Cristiano Ronaldo': {
        'age': 33,
        'nationality': 'Portugal',
        'teams': ['Juventus', 'Real Madrid', 'Manchester United']
    },
    'Neymar Jr': {
        'age': 26,
        'nationality': 'Brazil',
        'teams': ['Santos', 'Barcelona', 'Paris Saint-German']
    },
    'De Gea': {
        'age': 27,
        'nationality': 'Spain',
        'teams': ['Atletico Madrid', 'Manchester United']
    },
    'K. De Bruyne': {
        'age': 27,
        'nationality': 'Belgium',
        'teams': ['Chelsea', 'Manchester City']
    }
}
```

### 4.1) Create a `list` of all the keys in the `players` dictionary. Store the list of player names in a variable called `player_names` to use in the next question.

Use [Python's documentation on dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) for help if needed. 


```python
# Replace None with appropriate code to get the list of all player names

player_names = None
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
player_names = list(players.keys())
```


```python
# Run this cell without changes to check your answer

print(player_names)
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
print(player_names)
```

    ['L. Messi', 'Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Neymar Jr', 'De Gea', 'K. De Bruyne']


### 4.2) Great! Now that we have the names of all players, let's use that information to create a `list` of `tuples` containing each player's name along with their nationality. Store the list in a variable called `player_nationalities`.


```python
# Replace None with appropriate code to generate list of tuples such that 
# the first element is a players name and the second is their nationality 
# Ex: [('L. Messi', 'Argentina'), ('Christiano Ronaldo', 'Portugal'), ...]

player_nationalities = None
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
player_nationalities = [(name, players[name]['nationality']) for name in player_names]
```


```python
# Run this cell without changes to check your answer

print(player_nationalities)
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
print(player_nationalities)
```

    [('L. Messi', 'Argentina'), ('Cristiano Ronaldo', 'Portugal'), ('Neymar Jr', 'Brazil'), ('De Gea', 'Spain'), ('K. De Bruyne', 'Belgium')]


### 4.3) Define a function called `get_players_on_team()` that returns a `list` of the names of all the players who have played on a given team.

Your function should take two arguments: 

- a dictionary of player information
- the team name (as a `string`) you are trying to find the players for 

**Be sure that your function has a `return` statement.**


```python
# Code here to define your get_players_on_team() function 

```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
def get_players_on_team(player_dict, team_name):
    player_list = []
    for player in player_dict:
        if team_name in player_dict[player]['teams']:
            player_list.append(player)
    return player_list
```


```python
# Run this cell without changes to check your answer

players_on_manchester_united = get_players_on_team(players, 'Manchester United')
print(players_on_manchester_united)
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
players_on_manchester_united = get_players_on_team(players, 'Manchester United')
print(players_on_manchester_united)
```

    ['Cristiano Ronaldo', 'De Gea']



```python

```
